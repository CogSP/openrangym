It combines 128 Standard Radio Nodes (SRNs), each equipped with NI USRP X310 Software-defined Radios (SDRs), with a Massive digital Channel Emulator (MCHEM) backed by an extensive FPGA routing fabric. MCHEM emulates in FPGA real-world wireless RF channels between the SRNs and it is able to capture effects such as fading, multipath, etc., for up to 256x256 independently customizable channels. Accessible as a cloud-based platform, Colosseum also provides unique experimentation and data-collection capabilities.

As an RF testbed Colosseum can be utilized to:
- Emulate multiple operational environments including in real-time with effects such as multipath and fading effects with high-fidelity ray-tracing
- Instantiate softwarized protocol stacks on a general-purpose infrastructure
- Carry out large scale testing and data-collection
- Implement Machine Learning algorithms in different wireless communications techniques such as spectrum sharing, dynamic spectrum access, extraction of signal intelligence and optimized routing, by providing built-in powerful computational resources
