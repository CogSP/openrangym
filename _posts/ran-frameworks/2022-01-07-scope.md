SCOPE is a development environment for softwarized and virtualized NextG cellular networks based on <a href="https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN" target="_blank">srsRAN</a>.
It provides: (i) A ready-to-use portable open-source cellular container with flexible 5G-oriented functionalities; (ii) data collection tools, such as dataset generation functions for recording cellular performance and metrics, and for facilitating data analysis; (iii) a set of APIs to control and reprogram key functionalities of the full cellular stack at run time (e.g., scheduling policy, slicing resource allocation), without requiring redeploying the network, and (iv) an emulation environment with diverse cellular scenarios closely matching real-world deployments for precise prototyping NextG network solutions.
SCOPE has been prototyped and benchmarked on the [Colosseum](/experimental-platforms/colosseum) wireless network emulator, where an LXC container of SCOPE has been made available, and it is portable to LXC-enabled testbeds.
